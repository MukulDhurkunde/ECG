## What is Forking?

Forking is essentially making a personal copy of someone else's project. This copy is entirely separate from the original project, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original. It's an essential step before making contributions.

## How to Fork This Repository

1. **Log In to GitHub:**
   If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to sign up. If you already have one, log in.

2. **Find the Repository:**
   Navigate to the main page of the repository you want to fork. In this case, you're already here!

3. **Fork the Repository:**
   Look for the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of the page. Click it, and GitHub will create a copy of this repository under your account.

4. **Wait for the Fork:**
   GitHub will take a moment to create the fork. Once it's done, you'll be redirected to your forked repository.

5. **Clone Your Fork:**
   To work on your local machine, clone your forked repository. Copy the HTTPS or SSH link by clicking the "Code" button and using the provided URL.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

6. **Make Changes:**
   Now you can make changes to your heart's content. Create a new branch for your changes using:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```

7. **Commit and Push:**
   After making changes, commit them and push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request:**
   Go back to the original repository and click on "Pull Requests" in the menu. Then click on "New Pull Request." GitHub will guide you through the process of creating a pull request to merge your changes into the original repository.
