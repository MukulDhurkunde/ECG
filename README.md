# MATLAB Repository Setup and Contribution Guide

Welcome to our MATLAB repository! Whether you're here to contribute or explore, follow this comprehensive guide to set up the repository, integrate with Jira, and install MATLAB.

## Repository Forking and Jira Integration Guide

### What is Forking?

Forking is creating a personal copy of a repository to work on your own changes. It's essential for making contributions without affecting the original project.

### How to Fork This Repository

1. **Log In to GitHub:**
   If you don't have a GitHub account, sign up. If you do, log in.

2. **Find the Repository:**
   Navigate to the main page of the repository you want to fork. Here you are!

3. **Fork the Repository:**
   Click the "Fork" button on the top-right. GitHub will create a copy under your account.

4. **Wait for the Fork:**
   GitHub will take a moment. Once done, you'll be redirected to your forked repository.

5. **Clone Your Fork:**
   Clone your fork to work locally. Use the provided URL after clicking the "Code" button.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

6. **Integrate Jira Ticket Workflow:**
   Before making changes, create a new branch named after a Jira ticket:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123-your-feature
   ```

   Replace "JIRA-123" with your actual Jira ticket.

7. **Make Changes:**
   Now make your changes. Commit them and push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   git push origin feature/JIRA-123-your-feature
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request:**
   Go back to the original repository, click "Pull Requests," and then "New Pull Request." GitHub will guide you. Mention the Jira ticket in your pull request for easy tracking.
